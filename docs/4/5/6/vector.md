## Specification

### 4.5.6.5 Vector graphics
Vector graphics use geometric primitives such as points, lines, curves and polygons, based on mathematical equations, to create images. These geometric primitives combined together allow the computer to reproduce the image. This allows the image to be scaled to any size without any loss in quality.

Bézier curves are used to store and reproduce curves in vector graphics. This allows lines to be curved using handles to manipulate them. You can use this to draw a circle with just 4 points connected by bézier curves.

One common format for vector graphics is the SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) format. This is based on XML, and stores lists of objects with the properties of those objects as attributes.
